Creating this web portfolio taught me how to structure a real-world project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I improved my skills in organizing project assets, creating responsive layouts, and using visual elements like images and graphics. The portfolio showcases my projects, quizzes, and design approach, and it reflects my growth as a web developer. I learned the importance of clean code, file structure, and presenting work in a professional way.
